This was for fun to showcase more js static navbar/ toggle btns and just a pretty hero layout. Update 9/2 ** Added a contact page with a cool translucent form and hover effect.
I want to share something that came to my head as I was creating and completing the contacts page. I want to share what I thought about the overall design and the look and what it was saying to me as the creater. This is what I thought and said. "Wow, this is the most ugliest website I've ever seen"! As I thought about this, I started to break this down into a positive emotion. I think we need to not judge, critisize, or look at people from the exterior and start appreciating people from within or how they have much to offer. This website, or short of that, exemplifys this to me. It's ugly, yes, but is fuctional, has it's centers in check, buttons hover when loved, and contact sends your kisses when given. Maybe just maybe, this brings this issue into perspective for whoever sees this which may only be but a few people. But, if they do, and if they read this, hopefully this will make them be more accepting of others, no matter what shape, what size, what color, what anything...Just maybe they'll love a little more!
